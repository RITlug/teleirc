## About

**RITlug Teleirc** is a NodeJS implementation of a [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) <=> [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) bridge.
Teleirc works with any IRC channel and Telegram group.
It bridges messages between a Telegram group and an IRC channel.

This bot was originally written for [RITlug](https://ritlug.com).
Today, it is used by various communities.

Our developer community is found in these channels.

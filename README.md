## About

**RITlug TeleIRC** is a Go implementation of a [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) <=> [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) bridge.
TeleIRC works with any IRC channel and Telegram group.
It bridges messages between a Telegram group and an IRC channel.

This bot was originally written for [RITlug](https://ritlug.com).
Today, it is used by various communities.

### Live demo

A public Telegram supergroup and IRC channel (on Freenode) are available for testing.
Our developer community is found in these channels.

NodeJS implementation of a [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) <=>
[IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) bridge for use with any
IRC channel and Telegram group


## About

**Teleirc** bridges communication between a Telegram group and an IRC channel.
The project is a lightweight NodeJS application.

This bot was originally written for [RITlug](http://ritlug.com) and our own
Telegram group and IRC channel. Today, it is used by various communities other
than just RITlug.

### Live demo

A public Telegram supergroup and IRC channel (on freenode) are available for you
to test. Our (small) development community is also found in these channels too.

* **[Telegram](https://t.me/teleirc)**
* **[IRC](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ritlug-teleirc)** (#ritlug-teleirc @ irc.freenode.net)

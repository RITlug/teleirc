RITlug Teleirc documentation
============================

RITlug Teleirc is a NodeJS implementation of a `Telegram <https://telegram.org/>`_ <=> `IRC <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat>`_ bridge.
Teleirc works with any IRC channel and Telegram group.
It helps bridge communication between a Telegram group and an IRC channel.

This bot was originally written for `RITlug <http://ritlug.com>`_ and our Telegram group and IRC channel.
Today, it is used by various communities other than just RITlug.
